# Notes & Practice Questions

## Notes
**Python** is a programming language and the Python interpreter software that
reads source code (written in Python) and performs its instructions.

The name *Python* comes from the British comedy group Monty Python.

A Python  **REPL** (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) aka **shell** lets you run Python
instructions one at a time and instantly shows you the results.

2 + 2  is an example of an **expression**

2 is a **value**.

\+ is an **operator**.

Expressions consist of values and operators.  They always evaluate down to a
single value.

A **data type** is a category for values.  Every value belongs to exactly one
data type.

#### Examples:

Integer: whole numbers

Float: numbers with a decimal point

String: text values that are surrounded by single quote characters (')

The meaning of an operator may change based on the data types of the values next
to it.

EG.
```python
>>> 2 + 2
4

>>> 'Alice + Bob'
'AliceBob'

>>>'Alice' * 5
'AliceAliceAliceAliceAlice'
```

A **variable** is like a box in the computer's memory where you can store a
single value.

Python has three rules for variable names:
1. It can only be one word with no spaces
2. It can use only letters, numbers and the underscore (_) character
3. It can't begin with a number

```python
# is used for comments in Python
```

The `str()`, `int()` and `float()` functions will evaluate to the string,
integer and float forms of the values you pass - respectively.

`int()` will always round DOWN a floating point number.
